# Deep Learning with PyTorch

## Overview
This repository contains various deep learning projects implemented using PyTorch. Each project follows a structured approach to ensure effective model development and evaluation.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Visualization & Pre-Processing**:
   - Explore and clean the data.
   - Handle missing values and normalize features.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Design and select the appropriate model.
   - Define layers and activation functions.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train the model using gradient descent.
   - Adjust hyperparameters and monitor performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess the modelâ€™s accuracy and generalization on test data.

5. **Outliers Handling**:
   - Detect and manage outliers to ensure model robustness.
